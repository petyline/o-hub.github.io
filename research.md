My fields of interest are Software Engineering, Computational Intelligence, Simulation and Modelling, Computational Optimization, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,
Algorithm and Data Structures, Machine theory and Modelling Big Data. In my dissertation, I study topics related to the Software Development effort estimation model with a focus on using machine learning models with optimization techniques in addressing these topics.
I have expanded my research interests as a doctoral researcher to include computational intelligence and have focused on computational optimization, premature convergence, and deep neural network related to other estimation problems.
