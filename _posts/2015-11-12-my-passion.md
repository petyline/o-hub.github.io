Considering the need in the academic sector of Nigeria today and the high level of hunger for knowledge, we are dedicated to preparing student not just for school exams but the making of technology that works in our society. and at the same time write reports, seminar,term-paper and project efficiently. This site provides a bridge between myself and Nigerian students in tertiary institutions and also those interested in IT and Computer Science, Mathematical Computations and Statistics. 

**Area of Interest**
- Software Engineering
- Computational Intelligence
- Simulation and Modelling
- Computational Optimization
- Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery
- Algorithm and Data Structures
- Machine theory and Modelling Big Data

## Current Research Hands-on
- Gradient Descent Optimization for space-control mode switching of ACC Vehicles

- Adjusted COCOMO for software development effort estimation using ANFIS

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
